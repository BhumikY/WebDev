💡 <b>The Problem</b>

NGOs and social enterprises desperately need affordable, high-quality digital services like graphic design, web development, and social media management.

At the same time, skilled and motivated youth in semi-rural (tier-2/tier-3) cities lack the platform to gain paid, professional experience.

This creates a "trust gap"—simple volunteer-matching sites fail because they cannot guarantee reliability or quality. This forces NGOs to hire expensive agencies, while talented students are left without a pathway to build their portfolios and earn an income.


✨ <b>Our Solution</b>

<b>SkillSetu</b> is a two-part ecosystem that creates a direct pipeline from learning to earning:

1. <b>Learn:</b> An ed-tech platform where college student volunteers (from social service groups) teach in-demand digital skills (e.g., video editing, UI/UX design, web development) to underprivileged individuals in semi-rural areas.

2. <b>Earn:</b> A "social impact agency" portal where these newly-skilled individuals are connected with NGOs and social enterprises for paid, project-based freelance work.

The platform acts as a trusted middleman, managing projects, ensuring quality, and handling payments. This creates a sustainable cycle:

<b>Learn Skills → Gain Experience → Earn Income → Build a Professional Portfolio</b>


🎯 <b>Key Features</b>

The platform is designed with three core user groups in mind:

<b>For Learners (from Tier-2/3 Cities)</b>

* <b>Structured Learning Paths:</b> Guided courses on skills like graphic design, video editing, and front-end development.

* <b>Live Mentorship:</b> Direct online classes and support from partnered college student mentors.

* <b>Portfolio Builder:</b> Automatically generates a professional portfolio from completed course projects and client work.

* <b>Guaranteed Gigs:</b> Access to an internal, vetted job board of paid projects from our NGO partners.

<b>For Mentors (College Students)</b>

* <b>Cohort Management:</b> A dashboard to manage their group of learners, track progress, and schedule classes.

* <b>Teaching Tools:</b> Integrated tools for conducting live online classes and sharing resources.

* <b>Impact Tracking:</b> Quantify their social service hours and the success of their students.

<b>For Clients (NGOs & Social Enterprises)</b>

* <b>Project Posting:</b> An easy-to-use form to post project requirements and budgets.

* <b>Vetted Talent Pool:</b> Access to a pool of affordable and skilled individuals, whose quality is guaranteed by the platform.

* <b>Managed Workflow:</b> The platform provides project management oversight to ensure deadlines and quality standards are met.

* <b>Secure Payments:</b> Simple and secure milestone-based payments.


🚀 <b>How It Works: The Pipeline</b>

1. <b>Recruit:</b> College social service groups partner with the platform to onboard student mentors.

2. <b>Train:</b> Mentors teach registered learners from semi-rural areas via the app's ed-tech modules and live classes.

3. <b>Certify:</b> Learners complete a capstone project to become "Platform-Verified."

4. <b>Connect:</b> NGOs post projects (e.g., "Design 5 social media posters").

5. <b>Execute:</b> A verified learner (or a small team) is assigned. The platform's project managers (or senior mentors) provide quality assurance.

6. <b>Deliver & Earn:</b> The NGO receives the high-quality work. The learner gets paid and adds a real-world project to their portfolio.
